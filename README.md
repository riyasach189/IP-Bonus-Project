# bonusprojectip
This was the bonus project, created by [@ded-avishi](https://www.github.com/ded-avishi), [@surat-ss](https://www.github.com/surat-ss) and myself for out Introduction to Programming Course at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology.
# Intro
We have created an arcade game machine, with the home screen created on Tkinter module on python by Prashi Jain.
There are four clickable buttons.
# Functionality
Three of them are linked to game modules, and one is linked to print out a discord bot server invite.
The first game is DareDive, which is inspired by the Club Penguin game Waverider, created by Surat SS.
The second game is ELements Unleashed, which is again inspired by the Club Penguin game Crad Jitsu, created by Surat SS. Currently there are some known bugs, but we are working on fixing them.
The third game is Galactic Shooter, which is a 8-bit space shooter game. Currently we only have one level, but we plan to add more levels in the coming time, created by Riya Sachdeva.
The discord bot named WhimsyBot has some fun and useful funnctions. They include some minigames, some basic discord moderation functionality and some functions to help us study our courses, created by Surat SS.
All graphics were created and modified by Prashi Jain.
# Conclusion
:D enjoy the game, incase some code doesnt work, try changing the absolute file path to relative or absolute according to your system.
